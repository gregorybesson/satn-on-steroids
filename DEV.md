# Installation
- git clone the project
- Creat a new app in the shopify partner account
- create the app directory in /app
- During the dev, we'll use the Satn app key and secret:
  - You need to start the web and frontend directories `yarn start` on /web `yarn start` on /frontend

- On a dev store, install the Satn app: you'll see the app in the admin interface. You can start developing the app :)
